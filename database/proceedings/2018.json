    "abstract": "We present a new measure for automatically estimating the confidence of musical key classification. Our approach leverages the degree of harmonic information held within a musical audio signal (its \u201ckeyness\u201d) as well as the steadiness of local key detections across the its duration (its \u201cstability\u201d). Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners\u2019 ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values. Finally, we introduce a new method called \u201croot note heuristics\u201d for the special treatment of tracks with low confidence. We show that by applying these root note heuristics, key detection results can be improved for minimalistic music.",

    "abstract": "Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions into labelled chord segments. However, temporal models have been shown to only smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames) which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model\u2014to be applied on chord sequences\u2014and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration models improves the results.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on Automatic Chord Extraction (ACE) has focused on the improvement of models based on machine learning. However, most models still fail to take into account the prior knowledge underlying the labeling alphabets (chord labels). Furthermore, recent works have shown that ACE performances have reached a glass ceiling. Therefore, this prompts the need to focus on other aspects of the task, such as the introduction of musical knowledge in the representation, the improvement of the models towards more complex chord alphabets and the development of more adapted evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose to exploit specific properties and relationships between chord labels in order to improve the learning of statistical ACE models. Hence, we analyze the interdependence of the representations of chords and their associated distances, the precision of the chord alphabets, and the impact of performing alphabet reduction before or after training the model. Furthermore, we propose new training losses based on musical theory. We show that these improve the results of ACE systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks. By analyzing our results, we uncover a set of related insights on ACE tasks based on statistical models, and also formalize the musical meaning of some classification errors.",

    "abstract": "Connectionist sequence models (e.g., RNNs) applied to musical sequences suffer from two known problems: First, they have strictly \u201cabsolute pitch perception\u201d. Therefore, they fail to generalize over musical concepts which are commonly perceived in terms of relative distances between pitches (e.g., melodies, scale types, modes, cadences, or chord types). Second, they fall short of capturing the concepts of repetition and musical form. In this paper we introduce the recurrent gated autoencoder (RGAE), a recurrent neural network which learns and operates on interval representations of musical sequences. The relative pitch modeling increases generalization and reduces sparsity in the input data. Furthermore, it can learn sequences of copy-and-shift operations (i.e. chromatically transposed copies of musical fragments)\u2014a promising capability for learning musical repetition structure. We show that the RGAE improves the state of the art for general connectionist sequence models in learning to predict monophonic melodies, and that ensembles of relative and absolute music processing models improve the results appreciably. Furthermore, we show that the relative pitch processing of the RGAE naturally facilitates the learning and the generation of sequences of copy-and-shift operations, wherefore the RGAE greatly outperforms a common absolute pitch recurrent neural network on this task.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an end-to-end framework for audio-to-score transcription. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automatic music transcription approach which obtains directly a symbolic score from audio, instead of performing separate stages for piano-roll estimation (pitch detection and note tracking), meter detection or key estimation. The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture directly trained with pairs of spectrograms and their corresponding symbolic scores in Western notation. Unlike standard pitch estimation methods, the proposed architecture does not need the music symbols to be aligned with their audio frames thanks to a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function. Training and evaluation were performed using a large dataset of short monophonic scores (incipits) from the RISM collection, that were synthesized to get the ground-truth data. Although there is still room for improvement, most musical symbols were correctly detected and the evaluation results validate the proposed approach. We believe that this end-to-end framework opens new avenues for automatic music transcription.",

    "abstract": "Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is an important task in music information retrieval. Prior work has focused on multiple fundamental frequency estimation (multi-pitch detection), the conversion of an audio signal into a timefrequency representation such as a MIDI file. It is less common to annotate this output with musical features such as voicing information, metrical structure, and harmonic information, though these are important aspects of a complete transcription. Evaluation of these features is most often performed separately and independent of multi-pitch detection; however, these features are non-independent. We therefore introduce M V 2H, a quantitative, automatic, joint evaluation metric based on musicological principles, and show its effectiveness through the use of specific examples. The metric is modularised in such a way that it can still be used with partially performed annotation\u2014 for example, when the transcription process has been applied to some transduced format such as MIDI (which may itself be the result of multi-pitch detection). The code for the evaluation metric described here is available at https://www.github.com/apmcleod/MV2H.",

Our model predicts pitch onset events and then uses those predictions to condition framewise pitch predictions. During inference, we restrict the predictions from the framewise detector by not allowing a new note to start unless the onset detector also agrees that an onset for that pitch is present in the frame. We focus on improving onsets and offsets together instead of either in isolation as we believe this correlates better with human musical perception. Our approach results in over a 100% relative improvement in note F1 score (with offsets) on the MAPS dataset. Furthermore, we extend the model to predict relative velocities of normalized audio which results in more natural-sounding transcriptions.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art automatic drum transcription (ADT) approaches utilise deep learning methods reliant on timeconsuming manual annotations and require congruence between training and testing data. When these conditions are not held, they often fail to generalise. We propose a game approach to ADT, termed player vs transcriber (PvT), in which a player model aims to reduce transcription accuracy of a transcriber model by manipulating training data in two ways. First, existing data may be augmented, allowing the transcriber to be trained using recordings with modified timbres. Second, additional individual recordings from sample libraries are included to generate rare combinations. We present three versions of the PvT model: AugExist, which augments pre-existing recordings; AugAddExist, which adds additional samples of drum hits to the AugExist system; and Generate, which generates training examples exclusively from individual drum hits from sample libraries. The three versions are evaluated alongside a state-of-the-art deep learning ADT system using two evaluation strategies. The results demonstrate that including the player network improves the ADT performance and suggests that this is due to improved generalisability. The results also indicate that although the Generate model achieves relatively low results, it is a viable choice when annotations are not accessible.",

    "abstract": "Despite being a core component of Western music theory, harmonic analysis remains a subjective endeavor, resistant automation. This subjectivity arises from disagreements regarding, among other things, the interpretation of contrapuntal figures, the set of \u201clegal\u201d harmonies, and how harmony relates to more abstract features like tonal function. In this paper, we provide a formal specification of harmonic analysis. We then present a novel approach to computational harmonic analysis: rather than computing harmonic analyses based on one specific set of rules, we compute all possible analyses which satisfy only basic, uncontroversial constraints. These myriad interpretations can later be filtered to extract preferred analyses; for instance, to forbid 7th chords or to prefer analyses with fewer non-chord tones. We apply this approach to two concrete musical datasets: existing encodings of 371 chorales by J.S. Bach and new encodings of 200 chorales by M. Pr\u00e6torius. Through an online API users can filter and download numerous harmonic interpretations of these 571 chorales. This dataset will serve as a useful resource in the study of harmonic/functional progression, voice-leading, and the relationship between melody and harmony, and as a stepping stone towards automated harmonic analysis of more complex music.",

Starting from such a musically motivated representation, we propose to further enhance the NMF-based salience representations with CNN layers, then to model the temporal structure by an RNN network and to estimate the dominant melody with a final classification layer.

Previous work addressed the problem by estimating note intensity using a polyphonic note model. However, they are limited because the note intensity is vulnerable to various factors in a recording environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the key velocity focusing on timbre change which is another cue associated with the key velocity. To this end, we separate individual notes of polyphonic piano music using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and feed them into a neural network that is trained to discriminate the timbre change according to the key velocity. Combining the note intensity from the separated notes with the statistics of the neural network prediction, the proposed method estimates the key velocity in the dimension of MIDI note velocity. The evaluation on Saarland Music Data and the MAPS dataset shows promising results in terms of robustness to changes in the recording environment.",

    "abstract": "Timbre discrimination, even for very brief sounds, allows identification and separation of different sound sources. The existing literature on the effect of duration on timbre recognition shows high performance for remarkably short time window lengths, but does not address the possible effect of musical training. In this study, we applied an adaptive procedure to investigate the effect of musical training on individual thresholds for instrument identification. A timbre discrimination task consisting of a 4-alternative forced choice (4AFC) of brief instrument sounds with varying duration was assigned to 16 test subjects using an adaptive staircase method. The effect of musical training has been investigated by dividing the participants into two groups: musicians and non-musicians. The experiment showed lowest thresholds for the guitar sound and highest for the violin sound, with a high overall performance level, but no significant difference between the two groups. It is suggested that the test subjects adjust the weightings of the perceptual dimensions of timbre according to different degrees of acoustic degradation of the stimuli, which are evaluated both by plotting extracted audio features in a feature space and by considering the timbral specificities of the four instruments.",

This task is important for not only automatic transcription but also many retrieval problems. In this paper, we use the newly released MusicNet dataset to study this front, by building and evaluating a convolutional neural network for making frame-level instrument prediction. We consider it as a multi-label classification problem for each frame and use frame-level annotations as the supervisory signal in training the network. Moreover, we experiment with different ways to incorporate pitch information to our model, with the premise that doing so informs the model the notes that are active per frame, and also encourages the model to learn relative rates of energy buildup in the harmonic partials of different instruments. Experiments show salient performance improvement over baseline methods. We also report an analysis probing how pitch information helps the instrument prediction task.

Since these two tasks have been dealt with independently, it is difficult to jointly estimate chords and melodies that are optimal in both tasks. Another problem is developing an interactive GUI that enables a user to partially update chords and melodies by considering the latent tree structure of music. To solve these problems, we propose a hierarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chord symbols, (2) a metrical Markov model for chord boundaries, (3) a Markov model for melody pitches, and (4) a metrical Markov model for melody onsets. The harmonic functions (syntactic roles) and repetitive structure of chords are learned by the PCFG. Any variables specified by a user can be optimized or sampled in a principled manner according to a unified posterior distribution. For improved melodization, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network can also be used. The subjective experimental result showed the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the structure of musical pieces constitutes a central research problem for music information retrieval, music generation, and musicology. At the present, models of harmonic syntax face challenges on the tasks of detecting local and higher-level modulations (most previous models assume a priori knowledge of key), computing connected parse trees for long sequences, and parsing sequences that do not end with tonic chords, but in turnarounds. This paper addresses those problems by proposing a new generative formalism Probabilistic Abstract Context-Free Grammars (PACFGs) to address these issues, and presents variants of standard parsing algorithms that efficiently enumerate all possible parses of long chord sequences and to estimate their probabilities. PACFGs specifically allow for structured non-terminal symbols in rich and highly \ufb02exible feature spaces. The inference procedure moreover takes advantage of these abstractions by sharing probability mass between grammar rules over joint features. The paper presents a model of the harmonic syntax of Jazz using this formalism together with stochastic variational inference to learn the probabilistic parameters of a grammar from a corpus of Jazz-standards. The PACFG model outperforms the standard context-free approach while reducing the number of free parameters and performing key finding on the \ufb02y.",

We introduce new methods for analysing this relationship, and apply them to large corpora representing three prominent genres of Western music: classical, popular, and jazz music. These methods centre on a generative sequence model with an exponential-family energy-based form that predicts chord sequences from continuous features. We use this model to investigate one aspect of instantaneous consonance (harmonicity) and two aspects of sequential consonance (spectral distance and voice-leading distance). Applied to our three musical genres, the results generally support the relationship between sensory consonance and harmony, but lead us to question the high importance attributed to spectral distance in the psychological literature. We anticipate that our methods will provide a useful platform for future work linking music psychology to music theory.",

    "abstract": "Generative models aim to understand the properties of data, through the construction of latent spaces that allow classification and generation. However, as the learning is unsupervised, the latent dimensions are not related to perceptual properties. In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments. Finally, we exhibit the generative capabilities of our spaces, that can directly synthesize sounds with continuous evolution of timbre perception.",

    "abstract": "Existing automatic music generation approaches that feature deep learning can be broadly classified into two types: raw audio models and symbolic models. Symbolic models, which train and generate at the note level, are currently the more prevalent approach; these models can capture long-range dependencies of melodic structure, but fail to grasp the nuances and richness of raw audio generations. Raw audio models, such as DeepMind\u2019s WaveNet, train directly on sampled audio waveforms, allowing them to produce realistic-sounding, albeit unstructured music. In this paper, we propose an automatic music generation methodology combining both of these approaches to create structured, realistic-sounding compositions. We consider a Long Short Term Memory network to learn the melodic structure of different styles of music, and then use the unique symbolic generations from this model as a conditioning input to a WaveNet-based raw audio generator, creating a model for automatic, novel music. We then evaluate this approach by showcasing results of this work.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown recently that deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn to generate music in the form of piano-rolls, which represent music by binary-valued time-pitch matrices. However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binaryvalued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binaryvalued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures. Moreover, deterministic binary neurons perform better than stochastic ones in both objective measures and a subjective test.

We then derive a version of joint 2D convolutional NMF, which we apply to the constant-Q spectrograms of the synchronized segments to learn a translation dictionary of sound templates from A to A\u2019. Finally, we apply the learned templates as filters to the song B, and we mash up the translated filtered components into the synthesized song B\u2019 using audio mosaicing.

Our model is part-invariant, i.e., it can process/generate any part (voice) of a music score consisting of an arbitrary number of parts, using a single trained model. For better incorporating structural information of pitch spaces, we use a structured embedding matrix to encode multiple aspects of a pitch into a vector representation. The generation is performed by Gibbs Sampling. Meanwhile, our model directly generates note spellings to make outputs human-readable. We performed objective (grading) and subjective (listening) evaluations by recruiting music theorists to compare the outputs of our algorithm with those of music students on the task of bassline harmonization (a traditional pedagogical task). Our experiment shows that errors of our algorithm and students are differently distributed, and the range of ratings for generated pieces overlaps with students\u2019 to varying extents for our three provided basslines.

However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most stateof-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock. Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a \ufb02exible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task; (2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.",

We encode pages as strings of diatonic pitch intervals, ignoring rests, to reduce the effect of such errors. We extract indices comprising lists of two kinds of \u2018word\u2019. Approximate matching is done by counting the number of common words between a query page and those in the collection.  The two word-types are (a) normal ngrams and (b) minimal absent words (MAWs). The latter have three important properties for our purpose: they can be built and searched in linear time, the number of MAWs generated tends to be smaller, and they preserve the structure and order of the text, obviating the need for expensive sorting operations.  We show that retrieval performance of MAWs is comparable with ngrams, but with a marked speed improvement. We also show the effect of word length on retrieval. Our results suggest that an index of MAWs of mixed length provides a good method for these tasks which is scalable to larger collections.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an approach for the task of optical music recognition (OMR) using deep neural networks. Our intention is to simultaneously detect and categorize musical symbols in handwritten scores, written in mensural notation. We propose the use of region-based convolutional neural networks, which are trained in an end-toend fashion for that purpose. Additionally, we make use of a convolutional neural network that predicts the relative position of a detected symbol within the staff, so that we cover the entire image-processing part of the OMR pipeline. This strategy is evaluated over a set of 60 ancient scores in mensural notation, with more than 15000 annotated symbols belonging to 32 different classes. The results re\ufb02ect the feasibility and capability of this approach, with a weighted mean average precision of around 76% for symbol detection, and over 98% accuracy for predicting the position.",

    "abstract": "The optical music recognition (OMR) field studies how to automate the process of reading the musical notation present in a given image. Among its many uses, an interesting scenario is that in which a score captured with a camera is to be automatically reproduced. Recent approaches to OMR have shown that the use of deep neural networks allows important advances in the field. However, these approaches have been evaluated on images with ideal conditions, which do not correspond to the previous scenario. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an end-to-end approach that uses a deep convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) over non-ideal image conditions of music scores. Consequently, our contribution also consists of Camera-PrIMuS, a corpus of printed monophonic scores of real music synthetically modified to resemble camera-based realistic scenarios, involving distortions such as irregular lighting, rotations, or blurring. Our results confirm that the CRNN is able to successfully solve the task under these conditions, obtaining an error around 2% at music-symbol level, thereby representing a groundbreaking piece of research towards useful OMR systems.",

The current state of the art considers the use of deep neural networks trained to classify every pixel of the image according to the image layer it belongs to. This process, however, involves a high computational cost that prevents its use in interactive machine learning scenarios. In this paper, we propose the use of a set of deep selectional auto-encoders, implemented as fully-convolutional networks, to perform image-to-image categorizations. This strategy retains the advantages of using deep neural networks, which have demonstrated their ability to perform this task, while dramatically increasing the efficiency by processing a large number of pixels in a single step. The results of an experiment performed with a set of high-resolution images taken from Medieval manuscripts successfully validate this approach, with a similar accuracy to that of the state of the art but with a computational time orders of magnitude smaller, making this approach appropriate for being used in interactive applications.",

We experiment with different network architectures, varying the number and size of the hidden layers, and with dropout. We integrate two voice entry estimation heuristics that estimate the entry points of the individual voices in the polyphonic fabric into the models. These heuristics serve to reduce error propagation at the beginning of a piece, which, as we have shown in previous work, can seriously hamper model performance. The models are evaluated on the 48 fugues from Johann Sebastian Bach\u2019s The Well-Tempered Clavier and his 30 inventions\u2014a dataset that we curated and make publicly available. We find that a model with two hidden layers yields the best results. Using more layers does not lead to a significant performance improvement. Furthermore, we find that our voice entry estimation heuristics are highly effective in the reduction of error propagation, improving performance significantly. Our best-performing model outperforms our previous models, where the difference is significant, and, depending on the evaluation metric, performs close to or better than the reported state of the art.",

For tasks that include framewise binary classification (e.g., onset detection, music transcription) classes are derived from output activation functions by identifying points of local maxima, or peaks. However, the operating principles behind peak picking are different to that of the cross entropy loss function, which minimises the absolute difference between the output and target values for a single frame. To generate activation functions more suited to peak-picking, we propose two versions of a new loss function that incorporates information from multiple time-steps: 1) multi-individual, which uses multiple individual time-step cross entropies; and 2) multi-difference, which directly compares the difference between sequential time-step outputs. We evaluate the newly proposed loss functions alongside standard cross entropy in the popular MIR tasks of onset detection and automatic drum transcription. The results highlight the effectiveness of these loss functions in the improvement of overall system accuracies for both MIR tasks. Additionally, directly comparing the output from sequential time-steps in the multidifference approach achieves the highest performance.",

In contrast to four other methods \u2013 data augmentation, instance normalization, spectral delta features, and per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) \u2013 that we evaluated on a largescale public dataset, zero-mean convolutions achieve perfect sound level invariance without any impact on prediction accuracy or computational requirements.

The generator is trained by jointly minimizing the reconstruction loss of an inverse problem, and a generation loss which computes a distance over scattering moments.

Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts. Experiments for singing voice separation indicate that our architecture yields a performance comparable to a stateof-the-art spectrogram-based U-Net architecture, given the same data.

These features describe properties at the arrival beat of a cadence and its surroundings, but also at other onsets heuristically identified to pinpoint chords preparing the cadence. The representation of each beat of the score as a vector of cadential features makes it possible to reformulate cadence detection as a classification task. An SVM classifier was run on two corpora from Bach and Haydn totaling 162 perfect authentic cadences and 70 half cadences. In these corpora, the classifier correctly identified more than 75% of perfect authentic cadences and 50% of half cadences, with low false positive rates.

A set of features in the time- and frequency- domains were extracted from the physiological signals and analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods. Results reveal 1) significant differences in some physiological features between positive and negative arousal and mood categories, and 2) effective classification of emotion responses based on physiological signals for some individuals. The findings can contribute to further improvement of emotion-aware intelligent MIR systems exploiting physiological signals as an objective and personalized input.",

Yet, adverse acoustic conditions, as, e. g., a performance in open-air, or a noisy analog recording, may affect its perception. State-of-the art methods for emotional speech evaluation have been applied to operatic voice, such as perception experiments, acoustic analyses, and machine learning techniques. Still, the extent to which adverse acoustic conditions may impair listeners\u2019 and machines\u2019 identification of emotion in vocal cues has only been investigated in the realm of speech. For our study, 132 listeners evaluated 390 nonsense operatic sung instances of five basic emotions, affected by three noises (brown, pink, and white), each at four Signal-to-Noise Ratios (-1 dB, -0.5 dB, +1 dB, and +3 dB); the performance of state-of-the-art automatic recognition methods was evaluated as well. Our findings show that the three noises affect similarly female and male singers and that listeners\u2019 gender did not play a role. Human perception and automatic classification display similar confusion and recognition patterns: sadness is identified best, fear worst; low aroused emotions display higher confusion.",

First, a review of the state-of-the-art regarding emotion and music was conducted, to understand how the various music concepts may influence human emotions. Next, well known audio frameworks were analyzed, assessing how their extractors relate with the studied musical concepts. The intersection of this data showed an unbalanced representation of the eight musical concepts. Namely, most extractors are low-level and related with tone color, while musical form, musical texture and expressive techniques are lacking. Based on this, we developed a set of new algorithms to capture information related with musical texture and expressive techniques, the two most lacking concepts. To validate our work, a public dataset containing 900 30-second clips, annotated in terms of Russell\u2019s emotion quadrants was created. The inclusion of our features improved the F1-score obtained using the best 100 features by 8.6% (to 76.0%), using support vector machines and 20 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation.",

In this paper we investigate the possibility to reconstruct perceived and imagined musical stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings based on two datasets. One dataset contains multichannel EEG of subjects listening to and imagining rhythmical patterns presented both as sine wave tones and short looped spoken utterances. These utterances leverage the well-known speech-to-song illusory transformation which results in very catchy and easy to reproduce motifs. A second dataset provides EEG recordings for the perception of 10 full length songs. Using a multi-view deep generative model we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a shared latent representation of brain activity and auditory concepts, such as rhythmical motifs appearing across different instrumentations. Introspection of the model trained on the rhythm dataset reveals disentangled rhythmical and timbral features within and across subjects. The model allows continuous interpolation between representations of different observed variants of the presented stimuli. By decoding the learned embeddings we were able to reconstruct both perceived and imagined music. Stimulus complexity and the choice of training data shows strong effect on the reconstruction quality.",

First, we introduce DALI, a large and rich multimodal dataset containing 5358 audio tracks with their time-aligned vocal melody notes and lyrics at four levels of granularity. The second goal is to explain our methodology where dataset creation and learning models interact using a teacher-student machine learning paradigm that benefits each other. We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding audio and adapt the annotations to it. To that end, we retrieve audio candidates from the Web. Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data. Comparing the time-aligned lyrics and the singing-voice probability, we detect matches and update the time-alignment lyrics accordingly. From this, we obtain new audio sets. They are then used to train new SVD students used to perform again the above comparison. The process could be repeated iteratively. We show that this allows to progressively improve the performances of our SVD and get better audiomatching and alignment.",

This limits our ability to measure the efficacy of computational models. This article describes the construction of a new, open data-set for multi-instrument recognition.

To address this challenge in ADT, this paper first examines the existing labeled datasets and how representative they are of the research problem. Next, possibilities of using unlabeled data to improve general ADT systems are explored. Specifically, two paradigms that harness information from unlabeled data, namely feature learning and student-teacher learning, are applied to two major types of ADT systems. All systems are evaluated on four different drum datasets. The results highlight the necessity of more and larger annotated datasets and indicate the feasibility of exploiting unlabeled data for improving ADT systems.",

The resulting variability of sounds, however, poses significant challenges to automated methods for analyzing guitar recordings. As data driven methods become increasingly popular for difficult problems like guitar transcription, sets of labeled audio data are highly valuable resources. In this paper we present GuitarSet, a dataset that provides high quality guitar recordings alongside rich annotations and metadata. In particular, by recording guitars using a hexaphonic pickup, we are able to not only provide recordings of the individual strings but also to largely automate the expensive annotation process. The dataset contains recordings of a variety of musical excerpts played on an acoustic guitar, along with time-aligned annotations of string and fret positions, chords, beats, downbeats, and playing style. We conclude with an analysis of new challenges presented by this data, and see that it is interesting for a wide variety of tasks in addition to guitar transcription, including performance analysis, beat/downbeat tracking, and chord estimation.",

For each song, the dataset contains a musical score for four instrument voices as well as expressive attributes for the dynamics and timbre of each voice. Unlike datasets comprised of General MIDI files, NES-MDB includes all of the information needed to render exact acoustic performances of the original compositions. Alongside the dataset, we provide a tool that renders generated compositions as NESstyle audio by emulating the device\u2019s audio processor. Additionally, we establish baselines for the tasks of composition, which consists of learning the semantics of composing for the NES synthesizer, and performance, which involves finding a mapping between a composition and realistic expressive attributes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a new dataset of time-aligned jazz harmony transcriptions. This dataset is a useful resource for content-based analysis, especially for training and evaluating chord transcription algorithms. Most of the available chord transcription datasets only contain annotations for rock and pop, and the characteristics of jazz, such as the extensive use of seventh chords, are not represented. Our dataset consists of annotations of 113 tracks selected from \u201cThe Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz\u201d and \u201cJazz: The Smithsonian Anthology,\u201d covering a range of performers, subgenres, and historical periods. Annotations were made by a jazz musician and contain information about the meter, structure, and chords for entire audio tracks. We also present evaluation results of this dataset using stateof-the-art chord estimation algorithms that support seventh chords. The dataset is valuable for jazz scholars interested in corpus-based research. To demonstrate this, we extract statistics for symbolic data and chroma features from the audio tracks.",

    "abstract": "The creation of a corpus of compositions in symbolic formats is an essential step for any project in systematic research. There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music.  This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora. We have assembled a corpus of Renaissance duos as a sample implementation, and present machine learning experiments demonstrating how inconsistent or na\u00efve encoding methodologies for corpus collection can distort results.",

    "abstract": "Carnatic music is replete with continuous pitch movement called gamakas and can be viewed as consisting of constant-pitch notes (CPNs) and transients. The stationary points (STAs) of transients \u2013 points where the pitch curve changes direction \u2013 also carry melody information. In this paper, the precision of sung notes in Carnatic music is studied in detail by treating CPNs and STAs separately. There is variation among the nineteen musicians considered, but on average, the precision of CPNs increases exponentially with duration and settles at about 10 cents for CPNs longer than 0.5 seconds. For analyzing STAs, in contrast to Western music, r\u00afaga (melody) information is found to be necessary, and errors in STAs show a significantly larger standard deviation of about 60 cents. To corroborate these observations, the music was automatically transcribed and re-synthesized using CPN and STA information using two interpolation techniques. The results of perceptual tests clearly indicate that the grammar is highly \ufb02exible. We also show that the precision errors are not due to poor pitch tracking, singer deficiencies or delay in auditory feedback.",

Although several proposed algorithms have shown high performances, we argue that there is still room for improving the singing voice detection system. In order to identify the area of improvement, we first perform an error analysis on three recent singing voice detection systems. Based on the analysis, we design novel methods to test the systems on multiple sets of internally curated and generated data to further examine the pitfalls, which are not clearly revealed with the currently available datasets.

While the importance of vocals in music preference is both intuitive and anticipated by psychological theory, we have not found any survey studies that confirm this commonly held assertion. We address two questions: (1) what components of music are most salient to people\u2019s musical taste, and (2) how do vocals rank relative to other components of music, in regards to whether people like or dislike a song. Lastly, we explore the aspects of the voice that listeners find important. Two surveys of Spotify users were conducted. The first gathered open-format responses that were then card-sorted into semantic categories by the team of researchers. The second asked respondents to rank the semantic categories derived from the first survey. Responses indicate that vocals were a salient component in the minds of listeners. Further, vocals ranked high as a self-reported factor for a listener liking or disliking a track, among a statistically significant ranking of musical attributes. In addition, we open several new interesting problem areas that have yet to be explored in MIR.",

Such an approach can benefit from a signal processing method that helps to enhance the true pitch contours on an image, and, a music language model with structural information on large-scale symbolic music data to be transfer into an audio-based model. In this paper, we propose a novel melody extraction system, using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with dilated convolution as the semantic segmentation tool. The candidate pitch contours on the time-frequency image are enhanced by combining the spectrogram and cepstral-based features. Moreover, an adaptive progressive neural network is employed to transfer the semantic segmentation model in the symbolic domain to the one in the audio domain. This paper makes an attempt to bridge the semantic gaps between signal-level features and perceived melodies, and between symbolic data and audio data. Experiments show competitive accuracy of the proposed method on various datasets.",

This work explores the importance of four cognitive decision-making factors (familiarity, genre preference, ease of vocal reproducibility, and overall preference) in\ufb02uence in the perception of \u201csingability\u201d, how attractive a song is to sing. In Experiment One, we develop a model to validate and empirically determine to what degree these factors are important when evaluating its singability. Results indicate that evaluations of how these four factors impact singability strongly correlate with pairwise evaluations (\u03c1 = 0.692, p < 0.0001), supporting the notion that singability is a measurable cognitive process. Experiment Two examines the degree to which timbral and rhythmic features contribute to singability. Regression and random forest analysis find that some selected features are more significant than others. We discuss the method we use to empirically assess the complex decisions, and provide a preliminary exploration regarding what acoustic features may motivate these choices.",

Such passages are vital for compression, classification and prediction tasks in MIR, and algorithms employing different techniques have been proposed to find musical patterns automatically. Human-annotated patterns have been collected and used to evaluate pattern discovery algorithms, e.g., in the Discovery of Repeated Themes & Sections MIREX task. However, state-of-the-art algorithms are not yet able to reproduce human-annotated patterns. To understand what gives rise to the discrepancy between algorithmically extracted patterns and human-annotated patterns, we use jSymbolic\uf732 to extract features from patterns, visualise the feature space using PCA and perform a comparative analysis using classification techniques. We show that it is possible to classify algorithmically extracted patterns, human-annotated patterns and randomly sampled passages. This implies: (a) Algorithmically extracted patterns possess different properties than human-annotated patterns (b) Algorithmically extracted patterns have different structures than randomly sampled passages (c) Human-annotated patterns contain more information than randomly sampled passages despite subjectivity involved in the annotation process. We further discover that rhythmic features are of high importance in the classification process, which should in\ufb02uence future research on automatic pattern discovery.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of patterns using a minimal set of assumptions constitutes a central challenge in the modeling of polyphonic music and complex streams in general. Skipgrams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance, the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skipgrams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering, recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that \ufb02exibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.",

Instrumentation is a key factor in determining musical sound characteristics. For example, a musical piece performed with vocals, electric guitar, electric bass, and drums can generally be associated with pop/rock music but not with classical or electronic. Therefore, visualizing instrumentation can help listeners browse music more efficiently. Instrudive visualizes musical pieces by illustrating instrumentation with multi-colored pie charts and displays them on a map in accordance with the similarity in instrumentation. Users can utilize three functions. First, they can browse musical pieces on a map by referring to the visualized instrumentation. Second, they can interactively edit a playlist that showing the items to be played later. Finally, they can discern the temporal changes in instrumentation and skip to a preferable part of a piece with a multi-colored graph. The instruments are identified using a deep convolutional neural network that has four convolutional layers with different filter shapes. Evaluation of the proposed model against conventional and state-of-the-art methods showed that it has the best performance.",

While most research in polyphonic instrument recognition focuses on predicting the predominant instruments in a given audio recording, instrument activity detection represents a generalized problem of detecting the presence or activity of instruments in a track on a fine-grained temporal scale. We present an approach for instrument activity detection in polyphonic music with temporal resolution ranging from one second to the track level. This system allows, for instance, to retrieve specific areas of interest such as guitar solos. Three classes of deep neural networks are trained to detect up to 18 instruments. The architectures investigated in this paper are: multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and convolutional-recurrent neural networks. An in-depth evaluation on publicly available multi-track datasets using methods such as AUC-ROC and Label Ranking Average Precision highlights different aspects of the model performance and indicates the importance of using multiple evaluation metrics.

We systematically evaluate harmonic/percussive and solo/accompaniment source separation algorithms as pre-processing steps to reduce the overlap among multiple instruments prior to the instrument recognition step. For the particular use-case of solo instrument recognition in jazz ensemble recordings, we further apply transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a previously trained instrument recognition model for classifying six jazz solo instruments.

The proposed method transcribes and aligns lyrics to solo-singing vocals using the imperfect transcripts from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and the published lyrics. The ASR provides time alignment between vocals and hypothesized lyrical content, while the non-aligned published lyrics correct the hypothesized lyrical content. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through three experiments. First, a human listening test shows that 73.32% of our automatically aligned sentence-level transcriptions are correct. Second, the automatically aligned sung segments are used for singing acoustic model adaptation, which reduces the word error rate (WER) of automatic transcription of sung lyrics from 72.08% to 37.15% in an open test. Third, another iteration of decoding and model adaptation increases the amount of reliably decoded segments from 44.40% to 91.96% and further reduces the WER to 36.32%. The proposed framework offers an automatic way to generate reliable alignments between lyrics and solosinging. A large-scale solo-singing and lyrics aligned corpus can be derived with the proposed method, which will be beneficial for music and singing voice related research.",

    "abstract": "The number of audience recordings of concerts on the internet has exploded with the advent of smartphones. This paper proposes a method to organize and align these recordings in order to create one or more complete renderings of the concert. The process comprises two steps: first, using audio fingerprints to represent the recordings, identify overlapping segments, and compute an approximate alignment using a modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and second, applying a cross-correlation around the approximate alignment points in order to improve the accuracy of the alignment. The proposed method is compared to two baseline systems using approaches previously proposed for similar tasks. One baseline cross-correlates the audio fingerprints directly without DTW. The second baseline replaces the audio fingerprints with pitch chroma in the DTW algorithm. A new dataset annotating real-world data obtained from the Live Music Archive is presented and used for evaluation of the three systems.",

    "abstract": "Musical features and descriptors could be coarsely divided into three levels of complexity. The bottom level contains the basic building blocks of music, e.g., chords, beats and timbre. The middle level contains concepts that emerge from combining the basic blocks: tonal and rhythmic stability, harmonic and rhythmic complexity, etc. High-level descriptors (genre, mood, expressive style) are usually modeled using the lower level ones. The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions. However, they are very important for human perception of music, and on some of them people can reach high agreement, even though defining them and therefore, designing a hand-crafted feature extractor for them can be difficult. In this paper, we derive the mid-level descriptors from data. We collect and release a dataset 1 of 5000 songs annotated by musicians with seven mid-level descriptors, namely, melodiousness, tonal and rhythmic stability, modality, rhythmic complexity, dissonance and articulation. We then compare several approaches to predicting these descriptors from spectrograms using deep-learning. We also demonstrate the usefulness of these mid-level features using music emotion recognition as an application.",

While both systems have the ability to disambiguate unknown artists relying exclusively on audio, we show that our system is more suitable in the case when enough audio data is available for each artist in the train dataset.

Domain adaptation is an approach aiming to eliminate the distributional discrepancy of the modeling data, so as to transfer learnable knowledge from one domain to another. With its great success in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, domain adaptation also shows great potential in music processing, for music is essentially a highly-structured semantic system having domaindependent information. Our proposed model contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the training data into a latent space, and the resulting latent representations along with its model parameters are then reused to regularize the representation learning of the downstream task where the data are in the other domain. The experiments on cross-domain music alignment, namely an audioto-MIDI alignment, and a monophonic-to-polyphonic music alignment of singing voice show that the learned representations lead to better higher alignment accuracy than that using conventional features. Furthermore, a preliminary experiment on singing voice source separation, by regarding the mixture and the voice as two distinct domains, also demonstrates the capability to solve music processing problems from the perspective of domain-adaptive representation learning.",

Therefore, when computer models are employed in music tasks, it can be useful to operate on interval representations rather than on the raw musical surface. Moreover, interval representations are transposition-invariant, valuable for tasks like audio alignment, cover song detection and music structure analysis. We employ a gated autoencoder to learn fixed-length, invertible and transposition-invariant interval representations from polyphonic music in the symbolic domain and in audio. An unsupervised training method is proposed yielding an organization of intervals in the representation space which is musically plausible. Based on the representations, a transposition-invariant self-similarity matrix is constructed and used to determine repeated sections in symbolic music and in audio, yielding competitive results in the MIREX task \u201dDiscovery of Repeated Themes and Sections\u201d.",

Furthermore, our analysis revealed that users typically have less connections within a country than cross-country ones, with the first being stronger social ties, though.

Even if she does not input such information, it has been reported that user attributes can be predicted with high accuracy by using her play log. How can users enjoy music when using an online music service while preserving their demographic anonymity? To solve this problem, we propose a system called Listener Anonymizer. Listener Anonymizer monitors the user\u2019s play log. When it detects that her confidential attributes can be predicted, it selects songs that can decrease the prediction accuracy and recommends them to her. The user can camou\ufb02age her play logs by playing these songs to preserve her demographic anonymity. Since such songs do not always match her music taste, selecting as few songs as possible that can effectively anonymize her attributes is required. Listener Anonymizer realizes this by selecting songs based on feature ablation analysis. Our experimental results using Last.fm play logs showed that Listener Anonymizer was able to preserve anonymity with fewer songs than a method that randomly selected songs.",

Our results indicate that music indeed alters people\u2019s behavior with respect to this social task.

Our approach consists of employing bipartite graph ranking algorithms to help discover important venues in artist-venue graphs mined from Facebook. We use both well-established algorithms, such as BiRank, and a modification of their common iterative scheme that avoids the impact of possibly erroneous heuristics to the ranking, which we call VenueRank. Resulting venue ranks are compared to those obtained from feature extraction for predicting the most listened artists and large listener increments in Spotify. This comparison yields high correlation between venue importance for listener prediction and bipartite graph ranking algorithms, with VenueRank found more robust against overfitting.",

To this end, the musical preferences of users in the context of music recommender systems have mostly been captured in collaborative filtering-based approaches. Alternatively, users can be characterized by their average listening behavior and hence, by the mean values of a set of content descriptors of tracks the users listened to. However, a user may listen to highly different tracks and genres. Thus, computing the average of all tracks does not capture the user\u2019s listening behavior well. We argue that each user may have many different preferences that depend on contextual aspects (e.g., listening to classical music when working and hard rock when doing sports) and that user models should account for these different sets of preferences.

However, finding discriminative features in an unsupervised way is challenging and supervised feature learning using semantic labels may involve noisy or expensive annotation. In this paper, we present a supervised feature learning approach using artist labels annotated in every single track as objective meta data. We propose two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to learn the deep artist features. One is a plain DCNN trained with the whole artist labels simultaneously, and the other is a Siamese DCNN trained with a subset of the artist labels based on the artist identity. We apply the trained models to music classification and retrieval tasks in transfer learning settings. The results show that our approach is comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the proposed approach captures general music audio features as much as the models learned with semantic labels.

At the same, the recent growth of digital music repositories makes necessary the development of novel time- and memory-efficient algorithms to deal with music data. One particularly interesting idea on the literature is transforming the music data into reduced representations, improving the memory usage and reducing the time necessary to assess the similarity. However, these techniques usually add other issues, such as an expensive preprocessing or a reduced retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method to summarize a recording in small snippets based on its self-similarity information. Besides, we present a simple way to compare other recordings to these summaries. We demonstrate, in the scenario of cover song identification, that our method is more than one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art adversaries, at the same time that the retrieval performance is not affected significantly. Additionally, our method is incremental, which allows the easy and fast update of the database when a new song needs to be inserted into the retrieval system.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing deep learning techniques to generate musical contents has caught wide attention in recent years. Within this context, this paper investigates a specific problem related to music generation, music style transfer. This practical problem aims to alter the style of a given music piece from one to another while preserving the essence of that piece, such as melody and chord progression. In particular, we discuss the style transfer of homophonic music, composed of a predominant melody part and an accompaniment part, where the latter is modified through Gibbs sampling on a generative model combining recurrent neural networks and autoregressive models. Both objective and subjective test experiment are performed to assess the performance of transferring the style of an arbitrary music piece having a homophonic texture into two different distinct styles, Bachs chorales and Jazz.",

    "abstract": "We introduce MIDI-VAE, a neural network model based on Variational Autoencoders that is capable of handling polyphonic music with multiple instrument tracks, as well as modeling the dynamics of music by incorporating note durations and velocities. We show that MIDI-VAE can perform style transfer on symbolic music by automatically changing pitches, dynamics and instruments of a music piece from, e.g., a Classical to a Jazz style. We evaluate the efficacy of the style transfer by training separate style validation classifiers. Our model can also interpolate between short pieces of music, produce medleys and create mixtures of entire songs. The interpolations smoothly change pitches, dynamics and instrumentation to create a harmonic bridge between two music pieces. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful attempt at applying neural style transfer to complete musical compositions.",

    "abstract": "Methods for interpreting machine learning models can help one understand their global and/or local behaviours, and thereby improve them. In this work, we apply a global analysis method to a machine listening model, which essentially inverts the features generated in a model back into an interpretable form like a sonogram. We demonstrate this method for a state-of-the-art singing voice detection model. We train up-convolutional neural networks to invert the feature generated at each layer of the model. The results suggest that the deepest fully connected layer of the model does not preserve temporal and harmonic structures, but that the inverted features from the deepest convolutional layer do. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of a large number of inputs suggests that the deepest layer in the model learns a decision function as the information it preserves depends on the class label associated with an input.",

    "abstract": "Melodic similarity is an important task in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) domain, with promising applications including query by example, music recommendation and visualisation. Most current approaches compute the similarity between two melodic sequences by comparing their local features (distance between pitches, intervals, etc.) or by comparing the sequences after aligning them. In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence. The similarity between two melodies is computed by using the distance between their individual RNN parameters. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-based similarity outperformed the baseline similarity obtained by directly comparing melodic sequences.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the benefit of considering stacked graphs to display audio data. Thanks to a careful use of layering of the spectral information, the resulting display is both concise and intuitive. Compared to the spectrogram display, it allows the reader to focus more on the temporal aspect of the time/frequency decomposition while keeping an abstract view of the spectral information. The use of such a display is validated using two perceptual experiments that demonstrate the potential of the approach. The first considers the proposed display to perform an identification task of the musical instrument and the second considers the proposed display to evaluate the technical level of a musical performer. Both experiments show the potential of the display and potential applications scenarios in musical training are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents two novel user interfaces for investigating the pattern content in monophonic jazz solos and exemplifies how these interfaces could be used for research on jazz improvisation. In jazz improvisation, patterns are of particular interest for the analysis of improvisation styles, the oral transmission of musical language, the practice of improvisation, and the psychology of creative processes. The ongoing project \u201cDig That Lick\u201d is devoted to addressing these questions with the help of a large database of jazz solo transcriptions generated by automated melody extraction algorithms. To expose these transcriptions to jazz researchers, two prototypes of user interfaces were designed that work currently with the 456 manually transcribed jazz solos of the Weimar Jazz Database. The first one is a Shiny application that allows exploring a set of 653 of the most common patterns by eminent players. The second one is a web interface for a general two-staged pattern search in the Weimar Jazz Database featuring regular expressions. These applications aim on the one hand at an expert audience of jazz researchers to facilitate generating and testing hypotheses about patterns in jazz improvisation, and on the other hand at a wider audience of jazz teachers, students, and fans.",

    "abstract": "Score following is the process of tracking a musical performance (audio) with respect to a known symbolic representation (a score). We start this paper by formulating score following as a multimodal Markov Decision Process, the mathematical foundation for sequential decision making. Given this formal definition, we address the score following task with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as synchronous advantage actor critic (A2C). In particular, we design multimodal RL agents that simultaneously learn to listen to music, read the scores from images of sheet music, and follow the audio along in the sheet, in an end-to-end fashion. All this behavior is learned entirely from scratch, based on a weak and potentially delayed reward signal that indicates to the agent how close it is to the correct position in the score. Besides discussing the theoretical advantages of this learning paradigm, we show in experiments that it is in fact superior compared to previously proposed methods for score following in raw sheet music images.",

    "abstract": "Song recommendation from listening counts is now a classical problem, addressed by different kinds of collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. Among them, Poisson matrix factorization (PMF) has raised a lot of interest, since it seems well-suited to the implicit data provided by listening counts. Additionally, it has proven to achieve state-ofthe-art performance while being scalable to big data. Yet, CF suffers from a critical issue, usually called cold-start problem: the system cannot recommend new songs, i.e., songs which have never been listened to. To alleviate this, one should complement the listening counts with another modality. This paper proposes a multi-modal extension of PMF applied to listening counts and tag labels extracted from the Million Song Dataset. In our model, every song is represented by the same activation pattern in each modality but with possibly different scales. As such, the method is not prone to the cold-start problem, i.e., it can learn from a single modality when the other one is not informative. Our model is symmetric (it equally uses both modalities) and we evaluate it on two tasks: new songs recommendation and tag labeling.",
