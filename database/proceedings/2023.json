    "abstract": "Musicology research suggests a correspondence between manual gesture and melodic contour in raga performance. Computational tools such as pose estimation from video and time series pattern matching potentially facilitate larger-scale studies of gesture and audio correspondence. We present a dataset of audiovisual recordings of Hindustani vocal music comprising 9 ragas sung by 11 expert performers. With the automatic segmentation of the audiovisual time series based on analyses of the extracted F0 contour, we study whether melodic similarity implies gesture similarity. Our results indicate that specific representations of gesture kinematics can predict high-level melodic features such as held notes and raga-characteristic motifs significantly better than chance.",

Many of these highly capable DL models, however, are computationally expensive. Researchers are moving towards smaller models capable of maintaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) results by embedding musical knowledge in the network architecture. Existing approaches employ convolutional blocks specifically designed to capture the harmonic structure. These approaches, however, require either large kernels or multiple kernels, with each kernel aiming to capture a different harmonic. We present TriAD, a convolutional block that achieves an unequally distanced dilation over the frequency axis. This allows our method to capture multiple harmonics with a single yet small kernel. We compare TriAD with other methods of capturing harmonics, and we observe that our approach maintains SOTA results while reducing the number of parameters required. We also conduct an ablation study showing that our proposed method effectively relies on harmonic information.",

While taniavartanam segments have been segmented from concerts earlier, no effort has been made to analyze these percussion segments. This paper attempts to further segment the taniavartanam portion into musically meaningful segments. A taniavartanam segment consists of an abhipraya, where artists show their prowess at extempore enunciation of percussion stroke segments, followed by an optional korapu, where each artist challenges the other, and concluding with mohra and korvai, each with its own nuances. This work helps obtain a comprehensive musical description of the taniavartanam in Carnatic concerts. However, analysis is complicated owing to a plethora of tala and nade. The segmentation of a taniavartanam section can be used for further analysis, such as stroke sequence recognition, and help find relations between different learning schools. The study uses 12 hours of taniavartanam segments consisting of four tala-s and five nade-s for analysis and achieves 0.85 F1-score in the segmentation task.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network models have become the dominant approach to a large variety of tasks within music information retrieval (MIR). These models generally require large amounts of (annotated) training data to achieve high accuracy. Because not all applications in MIR have sufficient quantities of training data, it is becoming increasingly common to transfer models across domains. This approach allows representations derived for one task to be applied to another, and can result in high accuracy with less stringent training data requirements for the downstream task. However, the properties of pre-trained audio embeddings are not fully understood. Specifically, and unlike traditionally engineered features, the representations extracted from pre-trained deep networks may embed and propagate biases from the model's training regime. This work investigates the phenomenon of bias propagation in the context of pre-trained audio representations for the task of instrument recognition. We first demonstrate that three different pre-trained representations (VGGish, OpenL3, and YAMNet) exhibit comparable performance when constrained to a single dataset, but differ in their ability to generalize across datasets (OpenMIC and IRMAS). We then investigate dataset identity and genre distribution as potential sources of bias. Finally, we propose and evaluate post-processing countermeasures to mitigate the effects of bias, and improve generalization across datasets.",

However, a more desirable future path is most likely somewhere in between these two polar opposites where productive and ethical human-AI collaboration could happen through the use of these tools. To explore this possibility, we first need to improve our understanding of how music creators perceive and utilize these types of tools in their creative process. We conducted case studies of a range of music creators to better understand their perception and usage of AI-based music creation tools. Through a thematic analysis of these cases, we identify the opportunities and challenges related to the use of AI for music creation from the perspective of the musicians and discuss the design implications for AI music tools.",

Tokenization can be performed in different ways, and recent research has focused on developing more efficient methods. However, the key differences between these methods are often unclear, and few studies have compared them. In this work, we analyze the current common tokenization methods and experiment with time and note duration representations.

State-of-the-art approaches to this task are based on machine learning, which entails having to label a training corpus, an error-prone, laborious, and expensive task that must be performed by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot strategy for building robust models by utilizing only partial annotations, therefore requiring minimal human effort. Specifically, we introduce a masking layer and an oversampling technique to train models using a small set of annotated patches from the training images. Our proposal enables achieving high performance even with scarce training data, as demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets. The results indicate that this approach achieves performance values comparable to models trained with a fully annotated corpus, but, in this case, requiring the annotation of only between 20% and 39% of this data.",

This representation would retain more information than its corresponding monotonic representation while maintaining relative simplicity for tasks such as rhythm analysis and generation. To validate this potential representation, we investigate whether experienced drummers can consistently represent and reproduce the rhythmic essence of a given drum pattern using only their two hands. We present TapTamDrum: a novel dataset of repeated dualizations from four experienced drummers, along with preliminary analysis and tools for further exploration of the data.",

We present and evaluate real-time guitar body percussion recognition and embedding learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNNs jointly trained with variational autoencoders (VAEs). We introduce a taxonomy of guitar body percussion based on hand part and location. We follow a cross-dataset evaluation approach by collecting three datasets labelled according to the taxonomy. The embedding quality of the models is assessed using KL-Divergence across distributions corresponding to different taxonomic classes. Results indicate that the networks are strong classifiers especially in a simplified 2-class recognition task, and the VAEs yield improved class separation compared to CNNs as evidenced by increased KL-Divergence across distributions. We argue that the VAE embedding quality could support control intimacy and rich interaction when the latent space's parameters are used to control an external synthesis engine.

However, compared to the image domain, gaining a clear understanding of the space of possible music audios is difficult because users cannot listen to the variations of the generated audios simultaneously. We therefore facilitate users in exploring not only text prompts but also audio priors that constrain the text-to-audio music generation process. This dual-sided exploration enables users to discern the impact of different text prompts and audio priors on the generation results through iterative comparison of them. Our developed interface, IteraTTA, is specifically designed to aid users in refining text prompts and selecting favorable audio priors from the generated audios. With this, users can progressively reach their loosely-specified goals while understanding and exploring the space of possible results. Our implementation and discussions highlight design considerations that are specifically required for text-to-audio models and how interaction techniques can contribute to their effectiveness.",

Meter, the most widespread example of such a temporal scheme, consists of several hierarchically organized pulses. Deviations from isochrony found in musical patterns are considered to form an expressive, micro level of organization that is distinct from the structural macro-organization of the basic pulse. However, polyrhythmic structures, such as those found in music from West Africa or the African diaspora, challenge both the hierarchical subdivision of durations and the structural isochrony of the above models. Here we present a model that integrates the macro- and micro-organization of rhythms by generating non-isochronous girds from isochronous pulses within a polyrhythmic structure. Observed micro-timing patterns may then be generated from structural non-isochronous grids, rather than being understood as expressive deviations from isochrony. We examine the basic mathematical properties of the model and show that meter can be generated as a special case. Finally, we demonstrate the model in the analysis of micro-timing patterns observed in Brazilian samba performances.",

    "abstract": "Music can convey ideological stances, and gender is just one of them. Evidence from musicology and psychology research shows that gender-loaded messages can be reliably encoded and decoded via musical sounds. However, much of this evidence comes from examining music in isolation, while studies of the gendering of music within multimodal communicative events are sparse. In this paper, we outline a method to automatically analyse how music in TV advertising aimed at children may be deliberately used to reinforce traditional gender roles. Our dataset of 606 commercials included music-focused mid-level perceptual features, multimodal aesthetic emotions, and content analytical items. Despite its limited size, and because of the extreme gender polarisation inherent in toy advertisements, we obtained noteworthy results by leveraging multi-task transfer learning on our densely annotated dataset. The models were trained to categorise commercials based on their intended target audience, specifically distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and mixed audiences. Additionally, to provide explainability for the classification in gender targets, the models were jointly trained to perform regressions on emotion ratings across six scales, and on mid-level musical perceptual attributes across twelve scales. Standing in the context of MIR, computational social studies and critical analysis, this study may benefit not only music scholars but also advertisers, policymakers, and broadcasters.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, humans are constantly exposed to music, whether through voluntary streaming services or incidental encounters during commercial breaks. Despite the abundance of music, certain pieces remain more memorable and often gain greater popularity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we focus on measuring and predicting music memorability. To achieve this, we collect a new music piece dataset with reliable memorability labels using a novel interactive experimental procedure. We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible. Certain intrinsic elements, such as higher valence, arousal, and faster tempo, contribute to memorable music. As prediction techniques continue to evolve, real-life applications like music recommendation systems and music style transfer will undoubtedly benefit from this new area of research.",

    "abstract": "Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is the field of research that studies how to computationally read music notation from written documents. Thanks to recent advances in computer vision and deep learning, there are successful approaches that can locate the music-notation elements from a given music score image. Once detected, these elements must be related to each other to reconstruct the musical notation itself, in the so-called notation assembly stage. However, despite its relevance in the eventual success of the OMR, this stage has been barely addressed in the literature. This work presents a set of neural approaches to perform this assembly stage. Taking into account the number of possible syntactic relationships in a music score, we give special importance to the efficiency of the process in order to obtain useful models in practice. Our experiments, using the MUSCIMA++ handwritten sheet music dataset, show that the considered approaches are capable of outperforming the existing state of the art in terms of efficiency with limited (or no) performance degradation. We believe that the conclusions of this work provide novel insights into the notation assembly step, while indicating clues on how to approach the previous stages of the OMR and improve the overall performance.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizer parameter inference searches for a set of patch connections and parameters to generate audio that best matches a given target sound. Such optimization tasks benefit from access to accurate gradients. However, typical audio synths incorporate components with discontinuities \u2013 such as sawtooth or square waveforms, or a categorical search over discrete parameters like a choice among such waveforms \u2013 that thwart conventional automatic differentiation (AD). AD libraries in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch typically ignore discontinuities, providing incorrect gradients at such locations. Thus, SOTA parameter inference methods avoid differentiating the synth directly, and resort to workarounds such as genetic search or neural proxies. Instead, we adapt and extend recent computer graphics methods for differentiable rendering to directly differentiate the synth as a white box program, and thereby optimize its parameters using gradient descent. We evaluate our framework using a generic FM synth with ADSR, noise, and IIR filters, adapting its parameters to match a variety of target audio clips. Our method outperforms baselines in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

Here, we show that drums, instrumentals, vocals, and mixed sources of naturalistic musical stimuli can be decoded from single-trial spatial patterns of auditory cortex activation as recorded using fMRI. Comparing classification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) further revealed similar neural encoding of vocals and mixed sources, despite vocals being most easily identifiable. These results highlight the prominence of vocal information during music perception, and illustrate the potential of using neural representations towards evaluating music source separation performance and informing future algorithm design.",

This paper proposes a Dual Attention-based Multi-scale Feature Fusion (DAMFF) method and a newly developed dataset named MER1101 for Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition (DMER). Specifically, multi-scale features are first extracted from the log Mel-spectrogram by multiple parallel convolutional blocks. Then, a Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is utilized to achieve multi-scale context fusion and capture emotion-critical features in both spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, a BiLSTM-based sequence learning model is employed for dynamic music emotion prediction. To enrich existing music emotion datasets, we developed a high-quality dataset, MER1101, which has a balanced emotional distribution, covering over 10 genres, at least four languages, and more than a thousand song snippets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DAMFF approach on both the developed MER1101 dataset, as well as on the established DEAM2015 dataset. Compared with other models, our model achieves a higher Consistency Correlation Coefficient (CCC), and has strong predictive power in arousal with comparable results in valence.",

Our conformer-based model works on the raw audio waveform and transcribes violin notes and their corresponding pitch deviations with 5.8 ms frame resolution and 10-cent frequency resolution. We demonstrate that our method (1) outperforms generic systems in the proxy tasks of violin transcription and pitch estimation, and (2) can automatically generate new training labels by aligning its feature representations with unseen scores.

The model is capable of controllable music generation with two paradigms: internal control and external control. Internal control refers to the process in which users pre-define a part of the music and then let the model infill the rest, similar to the task of masked music generation (or music inpainting). External control conditions the model with external yet related information, such as chord, texture, or other features, via the cross-attention mechanism. We show that by using internal and external controls, Polyffusion unifies a wide range of music creation tasks, including melody generation given accompaniment, accompaniment generation given melody, arbitrary music segment inpainting, and music arrangement given chords or textures. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms existing transformer and sampling-based baselines, and using pre-trained disentangled representations as external conditions yields more effective controls.",

Motivated by recent findings that listeners' EEG responses correlate when hearing a shared music stimulus, we investigate whether responses correlate not only within single choruses but across pairs of chorus instances as well.

The success of current methods is therefore limited by the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of accurate annotations.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel technique for learning MPE without any pitch annotations at all. Our approach exploits multiple recorded versions of a musical piece as surrogate targets. Given one version of a piece as input, we train a network to minimize the distance between its output and time-frequency representations of other versions of that piece. \nSince all versions are based on the same musical score, we hypothesize that the learned output corresponds to pitch estimates. To further ensure that this hypothesis holds, we incorporate domain knowledge about overtones and noise levels into the network.\nOverall, our method replaces strong pitch annotations with weaker and easier-to-obtain cross-version targets.\nIn our experiments, we show that our proposed approach yields viable multi-pitch estimates and outperforms two baselines.",

    "abstract": "Generating a stereophonic presentation from a monophonic audio signal is a challenging open task, especially if the goal is to obtain a realistic spatial imaging with a specific panning of sound elements. In this work, we propose to convert mono to stereo by means of predicting parametric stereo (PS) parameters using both nearest neighbor and deep network approaches. In combination with PS, we also propose to model the task with generative approaches, allowing to synthesize multiple and equally-plausible stereo renditions from the same mono signal. To achieve this, we consider both autoregressive and masked token modelling approaches. We provide evidence that the proposed PS-based models outperform a competitive classical decorrelation baseline and that, within a PS prediction framework, modern generative models outshine equivalent non-generative counterparts. Overall, our work positions both PS and generative modelling as strong and appealing methodologies for mono-to-stereo upmixing. A discussion of the limitations of these approaches is also provided.",

This leads to research questions on whether these models can be used to learn representations for different music cultures and styles, or whether we can build similar music audio embedding models trained on data from different cultures or styles. To that end, we leverage transfer learning methods to derive insights about the similarities between the different music cultures to which the data belongs to. We use two Western music datasets, two traditional/folk datasets coming from eastern Mediterranean cultures, and two datasets belonging to Indian art music. Three deep audio embedding models are trained and transferred across domains, including two CNN-based and a Transformer-based architecture, to perform auto-tagging for each target domain dataset.

To address this limitation, researchers have resorted to labeling examples for specific neural models, which is time-consuming and raises questions about usability. In this study, we propose a holistic and comprehensive study for dealing with new music collections in OMR, including extensive experiments to identify key aspects to have in mind that lead to better performance ratios.

    "abstract": "In piano performance, some mistakes stand out to listeners, whereas others may go unnoticed. Former research concluded that the salience of mistakes depended on factors including their contextual appropriateness and a listener\u2019s degree of familiarity to what is being performed. A conspicuous error is considered to be an area where there is something obviously wrong with the performance, which a listener can detect regardless of their degree of knowledge of what is being performed. Analogously, this paper attempts to build a score-independent conspicuous error detector for standard piano repertoire of beginner to intermediate students. We gather three qualitatively different piano playing MIDI data: (1) 103 sight-reading sessions for beginning and intermediate adult pianists with formal music training, (2) 245 performances by presumably late-beginner to early-advanced pianists on a digital piano, and (3) 50 etude performances by an advanced pianist. The data was annotated at the regions considered to contain conspicuous mistakes. Then, we use a Temporal Convolutional Network to detect the sites of such mistakes from the piano roll. We investigate the use of two pre-training methods to overcome data scarcity: (1) synthetic data with procedurally-generated mistakes, and (2) training a part of the model as a piano roll auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation shows that the TCN performs at an F-measure of 0.78 without pretraining for sight-reading data, but the proposed pretraining steps improve the F-measure on performance and etude data, approaching the agreement between human raters on conspicuous error labels. Importantly, we report on the lessons learned from this pilot study, and what should be addressed to continue this research direction.",

With just 36 sampling passes, VampNet can generate coherent high-fidelity musical waveforms. We show that by prompting VampNet in various ways, we can apply it to tasks like music compression, inpainting, outpainting, continuation, and looping with variation (vamping). Appropriately prompted, VampNet is capable of maintaining style, genre, instrumentation, and other high-level aspects of the music.

Each recording was evaluated by both expert piano instructors and novice players. This dataset is unique in that the novice evaluators are also players, and that both quantitative and qualitative evaluations are collected.

Numerous complementary embeddings can be derived from processing items originally represented in several modalities, e.g., audio signals, user interaction data, or editorial data. However, data of any given modality might not be available for all items in any music dataset. In this work, we propose a method based on contrastive learning to combine embeddings from multiple modalities and explore the impact of the presence or absence of embeddings from diverse modalities in an artist similarity task. Experiments on two datasets suggest that our contrastive method outperforms single-modality embeddings and baseline algorithms for combining modalities, both in terms of artist retrieval accuracy and coverage. Improvements with respect to other methods are particularly significant for less popular query artists. We demonstrate our method successfully combines complementary information from diverse modalities, and is more robust to missing modality data (i.e., it better handles the retrieval of artists with different modality embeddings than the query artist\u2019s).",

While repetition structure can be modeled using context-free grammars,\n  most prior approaches allow for arbitrary grammar rules. Constraining the structure of the inferred rules to conform to a small set of templates (meta-rules) not only reduces the space of possible rules that need to be considered but also ensures that the resulting repetition grammar remains interpretable in the context of musical form.\n  The resulting formalism can be extended to cases of varied repetition and thus constitutes a building block for a larger model of form.",

This vector summarises the pitches that are in the preceding and following contexts of the note. Next, we use these pitch context vectors to generate a list of candidate chords for each note. The candidate chords fit the pitch context of a given note each with a computed strength. Finally, we find an optimal path through the chord candidates, employing a score function for the fitness of a given candidate chord. The algorithm chooses one chord for each note, optimizing the total score. A set of heuristics is incorporated in the score function. The system is heavily parameterised, extremely flexible, and does not need training. This creates a framework to experiment with harmonization of melodies. The output is evaluated by an expert survey, which yields convincing and positive results.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a text-to-lyrics generation method, aiming to provide lyric writing support by suggesting the generated lyrics to users who struggle to find the right words to convey their message. Previous studies on lyrics generation have focused on generating lyrics based on semantic constraints such as specific keywords, lyric style, and topics. However, these methods had limitations because users could not freely input their intentions as text. Even if such intentions can be given as input text, the lyrics generated from the input tend to contain similar wording, making it difficult to inspire the user. Our method is therefore developed to generate lyrics that (1) convey a message similar to the input text and (2) contain wording different from the input text. A straightforward approach of training a text-to-lyrics encoder-decoder is not feasible since there is no text-lyric paired data for this purpose. To overcome this issue, we divide the text-to-lyrics generation process into a two-step pipeline, eliminating the need for text-lyric paired data. (a) First, we use an existing text-to-image generation technique as a text analyzer to obtain an image that captures the meaning of the input text, ignoring the wording. (b) Next, we use our proposed image-to-lyrics encoder-decoder (I2L) to generate lyrics from the obtained image while preserving its meaning. The training of this I2L model only requires pairs of \"lyrics\" and \"images generated from lyrics\", which are readily prepared. In addition, we propose for the first time a lyrics generation method that reduces the risk of plagiarism by prohibiting the generation of uncommon phrases in the training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate lyrics with different phrasing while conveying a message similar to the input text.",

To address this data scarcity issue, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to artificially generate the description sentences from large-scale tag datasets. This results in approximately 2.2M captions paired with 0.5M audio clips. We term it Large Language Model based Pseudo music caption dataset, shortly, LP-MusicCaps. We conduct a systemic evaluation of the large-scale music captioning dataset with various quantitative evaluation metrics used in the field of natural language processing as well as human evaluation. In addition, we trained a transformer-based music captioning model with the dataset and evaluated it under zero-shot and transfer-learning settings.

However, most existing unsupervised training strategies omit the notion of repetition and therefore fail at encompassing this essential aspect of music structure. This work introduces a triplet mining method which explicitly considers repeating sequences occurring inside a music track by leveraging common audio descriptors. We study its impact on the learned representations through downstream music segmentation. Because musical repetitions can be of different natures, we give further insight on the role of the audio descriptors employed at the triplet mining stage as well as the trade-off existing between the quality of the triplets mined and the quantity of unlabelled data used for training. We observe that our method requires less non-annotated data while remaining competitive against other unsupervised methods trained on a larger corpus.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a data-driven framework to parse musical sequences into dependency trees, which are hierarchical structures used in music cognition research and music analysis.\u00a0The parsing involves two steps. First, the input sequence is passed through a transformer encoder to enrich it with contextual information.\u00a0Then, a classifier filters the graph of all possible dependency arcs to produce the dependency tree.\nOne major benefit of this system is that it can be easily integrated into modern deep-learning pipelines. Moreover, since it does not rely on any particular symbolic grammar, it can consider multiple musical features simultaneously, make use of sequential context information, and produce partial results for noisy inputs.\u00a0We test our approach on two datasets of musical trees -- time-span trees of monophonic note sequences and harmonic trees of jazz chord sequences -- and show that our approach outperforms previous methods.",

    "abstract": "Soft dynamic time warping (SDTW) is a differentiable loss function that allows for training neural networks from weakly aligned data. Typically, SDTW is used to iteratively compute and refine soft alignments that compensate for temporal deviations between the training data and its weakly annotated targets. One major problem is that a mismatch between the estimated soft alignments and the reference alignments in the early training stage leads to incorrect parameter updates, making the overall training procedure unstable. In this paper, we investigate such stability issues by considering the task of pitch class estimation from music recordings as an illustrative case study. In particular, we introduce and discuss three conceptually different strategies (a hyperparameter scheduling, a diagonal prior, and a sequence unfolding strategy) with the objective of stabilizing intermediate soft alignment results. Finally, we report on experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies and discuss efficiency and implementation issues.",

Because most of the songs were sung by non-expert musicians without accompaniment, the dataset provides several challenges. To address this challenge, we utilized self-supervised learning with convolutional neural network based on pitch contour, then analyzed how the musical concept of tori, a classification system defined by a specific scale, ornamental notes, and an idiomatic melodic contour, is captured by the model. The experimental result shows that our approach can better capture the characteristics of tori compared to traditional pitch histograms. Using our approaches, we have examined how musical discussions proposed in existing academia manifest in the actual field recordings of Korean folk songs.",

We explore different self-supervised learning techniques on a large collection of isolated vocal tracks and apply data augmentations during training to ensure that the representations are invariant to pitch and content variations. We evaluate the quality of the resulting representations on singer similarity and identification tasks across multiple datasets, with a particular emphasis on out-of-domain generalization. Our proposed framework produces high-quality embeddings that outperform both speaker verification and wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained baselines on singing voice while operating at 44.1 kHz.

While previous SSL models pre-trained on music recordings may have been mostly closed-sourced, recent models such as wav2vec2.0 have shown promise. Nevertheless, research exploring the effectiveness of applying speech SSL models to music recordings has been limited. We explore the music adaption of SSL with two distinctive speech-related models, data2vec1.0 and Hubert, and refer to them as music2vec and musicHuBERT, respectively. We train 12 SSL models with 95M parameters under various pre-training configurations and systematically evaluate the MIR task performances with 13 different MIR tasks. Our findings suggest that training with music data can generally improve performance on MIR tasks, even when models are trained using paradigms designed for speech. However, we identify the limitations of such existing speech-oriented designs, especially in modelling polyphonic information.

Due to the long sequential inputs, it is still challenging to model the global structure efficiently and to deal with the data imbalance between beats and no beats. In order to meet the above challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model consisting of a low-resolution encoder and a high-resolution decoder. The encoder with low temporal resolution is suited to capture global features with more balanced data. The decoder with high temporal resolution is designed to predict beat times at a desired resolution. In the decoder, the global structure is considered by the cross attention between the global features and high-dimensional features. There are two key modifications in the proposed model: (1) adding 1D convolutional layers in the encoder and (2) replacing positional embedding by the upsampled encoder features in the decoder. In the experiment, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance and showed that the decoder produced more precise and stable results.",

Therefore, it is essential to consider all stakeholders' goals and values when developing and evaluating the music recommender systems integrated into these services. One vital goal is treating artists fairly, thereby giving them a fair chance to have their music recommended and listened to, and subsequently building a fan base. Such artist fairness is often assumed to have a trade-off with user goals such as satisfaction. Using insights from two studies, this work shows the opposite: some goals from different stakeholders are complementary. Our first study, in which we interview music artists, demonstrates that they often see increased transparency and control for users as a means to also improve artist fairness. We expand with a second study asking other music industry professionals about these topics using a questionnaire. Its results indicate that transparency towards users is highly valued and should be increased.",

However, notwithstanding the surge in the platform's utilization as a music consumption tool, there is a lack of thorough research on the phenomenon. To investigate its usability and interface satisfaction as a music listening tool, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 users who listen to music through YouTube more than three times a week. Our qualitative analysis found that YouTube has five main meanings for users as a music streaming service: 1) exploring musical diversity, 2) sharing unique playlists, 3) providing visual satisfaction, 4) facilitating user interaction, and 5) allowing free and easy access. We also propose wireframes of a video streaming service for better audio-visual music listening in two stages: search and listening.

Our proposed model is a generic encoder-decoder Transformer model but adopts multi-task learning with CTC from the encoder to speed up learning alignments between the output tokens and acoustic features. Our proposed data augmentation methods scale up the amount of training data by 1) creating bar overlap when splitting an excerpt to be used for network input, and 2) by utilizing MIDI-only data to synthetically create audio-MIDI pair data. We confirmed that 1) the proposed data augmentation methods were highly effective for training generic Transformer models that generate tokenized outputs, 2) our proposed hybrid CTC-Attention model outperforms conventional methods that transcribe guitar performance with tokens, and 3) the addition of multi-task learning with CTC in our proposed model is especially effective when there is an insufficient amount of training data.",

To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices.\n\nWe evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications.

Over 1000 citations of ISMIR papers were reviewed, and out of these, 51 later works published in musicological venues drew from the findings of 28 ISMIR papers. Final results reveal that most contributions from ISMIR rarely make their way to musicology or humanities. Nevertheless, the paper highlights four examples of successful knowledge transfers between the fields and discusses best practices for collaborations while addressing potential causes for such disparities.

In this work, we address the task of singing voice separation when the ground-truth signals have bleeding and only the target vocals and the corresponding mixture are available. We train a cold diffusion model on the frequency domain to iteratively transform a mixture into the corresponding vocals with bleeding. Next, we build the final separation masks by clustering spectrogram bins according to their evolution along the transformation steps. We test our approach on a Carnatic music scenario for which solely datasets with bleeding exist, while current research on this repertoire commonly uses source separation models trained solely with Western commercial music. Our evaluation on a Carnatic test set shows that our system improves Spleeter on interference removal and it is competitive in terms of signal distortion. Code is open sourced",

The user survey results provide several reusable insights, including the following: (1) for most participants, the melody and singing voice are important factors in judging whether they like a song on first listen; (2) personal characteristics do influence the important factors (e.g., participants who have high openness and are sensitive to beat deviations emphasize melody); and (3) the proposed functions each have a certain level of demand because they enable users to easily find music that fits their tastes. We have released part of the survey results as publicly available data so that other researchers can reproduce the results and analyze the data from their own viewpoints.",

With the development of deep learning models, the last decade has seen impressive improvements in a wide range of classification tasks. However, the increasing model complexity makes both training and inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we integrate the ideas of transfer learning and feature-based knowledge distillation and systematically investigate using pre-trained audio embeddings as teachers to guide the training of low-complexity student networks. By regularizing the feature space of the student networks with the pre-trained embeddings, the knowledge in the teacher embeddings can be transferred to the students. We use various pre-trained audio embeddings and test the effectiveness of the method on the tasks of musical instrument classification and music auto-tagging. Results show that our method significantly improves the results in comparison to the identical model trained without the teacher\u2019s knowledge. This technique can also be combined with classical knowledge distillation approaches to further improve the model\u2019s performance.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the temporal unfolding of musical events and its interpretation in terms of hierarchical relations is a common theme in music theory, cognition, and composition. To faithfully encode such relations, we need an elegant way to represent both the semantics of prolongation, where a single event is elaborated into multiple events, and process, where the connection from one event to another is elaborated into multiple connections. In existing works, trees are used to capture the former and graphs for the latter. Each such model has the potential to either encode relations between events (e.g., an event being a repetition of another), or relations between processes (e.g., two consecutive steps making up a larger skip), but not both together explicitly. To model meaningful relations between musical events and processes and combine the semantic expressiveness of trees and graphs, we propose a structured representation using  algebraic datatype (ADT) with dependent type. We demonstrate its applications towards encoding functional interpretations of harmonic progressions, and large scale organizations of key regions. This paper offers two contributions. First, we provide a novel unifying hierarchical framework for musical processes and events. Second, we provide a structured data type encoding such interpretations, which could facilitate computational approaches in music theory and generation.",

To enhance the model's sensitivity on the trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP) representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet, modified from a piano transcription network.

In this work, we explore the application of machine learning to automatically assess timbre quality in trumpet playing, given both its educational value and connection to performance quality. An extensive dataset consisting of more than 19,000 tones played by 110 trumpet players of different expertise has been collected. A subset of 1,481 tones from this dataset was labeled by eight professional graders on a scale of 1 to 4 based on the perceived efficiency of sound production. Statistical analysis is performed to identify the correlation among the assigned ratings by the expert graders. A Random Forest classifier is trained using the mode of the ratings and its accuracy and variability is assessed with respect to the variability in human graders as a reference. An analysis of the important discriminatory features identifies stability of spectral peaks as a critical factor in trumpet timbre quality.",

    "abstract": "Many applications of cross-modal music retrieval are related to connecting sheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music snippets caused by local and global tempo deviations. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it only requires weakly aligned audio - sheet music pairs, as well as that the recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the performance difficulty of a musical score is crucial in music education for adequately designing the learning curriculum of the students. Although the music information retrieval community has recently shown interest in this task, existing approaches mainly use machine-readable scores, leaving the broader case of sheet music images unaddressed. Based on previous works involving sheet music images, we use a mid-level representation, bootleg score, describing notehead positions relative to staff lines coupled with a transformer model. This architecture is adapted to our task by introducing a different encoding scheme that reduces the encoded sequence length to one-eighth of the original size. In terms of evaluation, we consider five datasets---more than 7500 scores with up to 9 difficulty levels---, two being mainly compiled for this work. The results obtained when pretraining the scheme on the IMSLP corpus and fine-tuning it on the considered datasets prove the proposal's validity, achieving the best-performing model with a balanced accuracy of 40.3\\% and a mean square error of 1.3. Finally, we provide access to our code, data, and models for transparency and reproducibility.",

In this paper, we propose an automated approach for refining mislabeled instrument tracks in a partially noisy-labeled dataset. The proposed self-refining technique with noisy-labeled dataset results in only a 1% accuracy degradation for multi-label instrument recognition compared to a classifier trained with a clean-labeled dataset. The study demonstrates the importance of refining noisy-labeled data for training MSS models and shows that utilizing the refined dataset for MSS leads to comparable results to a clean-labeled dataset.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the difficulty of playing songs has recently gained traction in the MIR community. While previous work has mostly focused on piano, this paper concentrates on rhythm guitar, which is especially popular with amateur musicians and has a broad skill spectrum. This paper proposes a rubric-based \u2018playability\u2019 metric to formalise this spectrum. The rubric comprises seven criteria that contribute to a single playability score, representing the overall difficulty of a song. The rubric was created through interviewing and incorporating feedback from guitar teachers and experts. Additionally, we introduce the playability prediction task by adding annotations to a subset of 200 songs from the McGill Billboard dataset, labelled by a guitar expert using the proposed rubric. We use this dataset to weight each rubric criterion for maximal reliability. Finally, we create a rule-based baseline to score each rubric criterion automatically from chord annotations and timings, and compare this baseline against simple deep learning models trained on chord symbols and textual representations of guitar tablature. The rubric, dataset, and baselines lay a foundation for understanding what makes songs easy or difficult for guitar players and how we can use MIR tools to match amateurs with songs closer to their skill level.",

In practice, the boundary conditions may not be known a priori or may not satisfy such strict assumptions.  This paper introduces an alignment algorithm called FlexDTW that is designed to handle a wide range of boundary conditions.  FlexDTW allows alignment paths to start anywhere on the bottom or left edge of the cost matrix (adjacent to the origin) and to end anywhere on the top or right edge.  In order to properly compare paths of very different lengths, we use a goodness measure that normalizes the cumulative path cost by the path length.  The key insight of FlexDTW is that the Manhattan length of a path can be computed by simply knowing the starting point of the path, which can be computed recursively during dynamic programming.  We artificially generate a suite of 16 benchmarks based on the Chopin Mazurka dataset in order to characterize audio alignment performance under a variety of boundary conditions.  We show that FlexDTW has consistently strong performance that is comparable or better than commonly used alignment algorithms, and it is the only system with strong performance in some boundary conditions.",

This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard.\n In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 and a limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of\nnon-guitar music into guitar tablatures.",

    "abstract": "In jazz, measuring harmonic similarity is complicated by the common practice of reharmonization -- the altering or substitution of chords without fundamentally changing the piece's harmonic identity. This is analogous to natural language processing tasks where synonymous terms can be used interchangeably without significantly modifying the meaning of a text.  Our approach to modeling harmonic similarity borrows from NLP techniques, such as distributional semantics, by embedding chords into a vector space using a co-occurrence matrix.  We show that the method can robustly detect harmonic similarity between songs, even when reharmonized.  The co-occurrence matrix is computed from a corpus of symbolic jazz-chord progressions, and the result is a map from chords into vectors. A song's harmony can then be represented as a piecewise-linear path constructed from the cumulative sum of its chord vectors.  For any two songs, their harmonic similarity can be measured as the minimal surface membrane area between their vector paths.  Using a dataset of jazz contrafacts, we show that our approach reduces the median rank of matches from 318 to 18 compared to a baseline approach using pitch class vectors.",

SingStyle111 incorporates different singing styles, such as bel canto opera, Chinese folk singing, pop, jazz, and children. Specifically, 80 songs include at least two distinct singing styles performed by the same singer. All recordings were conducted in professional studios, yielding clean, dry vocal tracks in mono format with a 44.1 kHz sample rate. We have segmented the singing voices into phrases, providing lyrics, performance MIDI, and scores with phoneme-level alignment. We also extracted acoustic features such as Mel-Spectrogram, F0 contour, and loudness curves. This dataset applies to various MIR tasks such as Singing Voice Synthesis, Singing Voice Conversion, Singing Transcription, Score Following, and Lyrics Detection. It is also designed for Singing Style Transfer, including both performance and voice timbre style. We make the dataset freely available for research purposes.

In this paper, we present a computational framework for the quantitative evaluation of singable lyric translation, which seamlessly integrates musical, linguistic, and cultural dimensions of lyrics. Our comprehensive framework consists of four metrics that measure syllable count distance, phoneme repetition similarity, musical structure distance, and semantic similarity. To substantiate the efficacy of our framework, we collected a singable lyrics dataset, which precisely aligns English, Japanese, and Korean lyrics on a line-by-line and section-by-section basis, and conducted a comparative analysis between singable and non-singable lyrics. Our multidisciplinary approach provides insights into the key components that underlie the art of lyric translation and establishes a solid groundwork for the future of computational lyric translation assessment.",

To this end, we conducted a questionnaire-based online user survey involving 214 participants. Our analysis results suggest reusable insights, including the following: (1) We show a high demand for listening to existing playlists with the chorus-playlist approach. We also reveal preferred options for chorus playback, such as adding crossfade transitions between choruses. (2) People listen to playlists with chorus-playlist for various objectives. For example, when they listen to their own self-made playlists, they want to boost a mood or listen to music in a specific context such as work or driving. (3) There is also a high demand for playlist creation on the premise of continuous listening to only the choruses of the songs in a playlist. The diversities of artists, genres, and moods are more important when creating such a playlist than when creating a usual playlist.",

To accomplish this, we train a high-capacity transformer model on a vast collection of highly-structured Irish folk melodies and analyze the musical qualities of the samples generated using distribution truncation sampling techniques. Specifically, we use nucleus sampling, the recently proposed \"typical sampling\", and conventional ancestral sampling. We evaluate the effect of these sampling strategies in two scenarios: optimal circumstances with a well-calibrated model and suboptimal circumstances where we systematically degrade the model\u2019s performance. We assess the generated samples using objective and subjective evaluations.

Each participating country is able to evaluate every other country's performance via a combination of rankings from professional jurors and telephone votes from viewers. Between fan sites and the official Song Contest organisation, a complete historical record of musical performances and country-to-country contest scores is available, back to the very first edition in 1956, and for the most recent contests, there is also information about each individual juror's rankings. In this paper, we introduce MIRoVision, a set of scripts which collates the data from these sources into a single, easy-to-use dataset, and a discrete-choice model to convert the raw contest scores into a stable, interval-scale measure of the quality of Eurovision Song Contest entries across the years. We use this model to simulate contest outcomes from previous editions and compare the results to the implied win probabilities from bookmakers at various online betting markets. We also assess how successful content-based MIR could be at predicting Eurovision outcomes, using state-of-the-art music foundation models. Given its annual recurrence, emphasis on new music and lesser-known artists, and sophisticated voting structure, the Eurovision Song Contest is an outstanding testing ground for MIR algorithms, and we hope that this paper will inspire the community to use the contest as a regular assessment of the strength of modern MIR.",

In contrast to previous works, we study how specific design decisions affect downstream music tagging tasks instead of focusing on the training task. We assess the impact of initializing the training with different existing weights, using various input audio segment lengths, using learned representations from different blocks and tokens of the transformer for downstream tasks, and applying patchout at inference to speed up feature extraction. We find that 1) initializing the audio training from ImageNet or AudioSet weights and longer input segments are beneficial both for the training and downstream tasks, 2) the best representations for the downstream tasks are located in the middle blocks of the transformer, and 3) using patchout at inference allows faster processing than our convolutional baselines while maintaining superior performance. The resulting models, MAEST, are publicly available and obtain the best performance among open models in music tagging tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new music source separation (MSS) model based on an architecture with MLP-Mixer that leverages multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Most of the recent MSS techniques are based on architectures with CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers that take waveforms or complex spectrograms or both as inputs. For the growth of the research field, we believe it is important to study not only the current established methodologies but also diverse perspectives. Therefore, since the MLP-Mixer-based architecture has been reported to perform as well as or better than architectures with CNNs and transformers in the computer vision field despite the MLP's simple computation, we report a way to effectively apply such an architecture to MSS as a reusable insight. In this paper we propose a model called TFC-MLP, which is a variant of the MLP-Mixer architecture that preserves time-frequency positional relationships and mixes time, frequency, and channel dimensions separately, using complex spectrograms as input. The TFC-MLP was evaluated with source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) using the MUSDB18-HQ dataset. Experimental results showed that the proposed model can achieve competitive SDRs when compared with state-of-the-art MSS models.",

    "abstract": "Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has seen a recent surge in deep learning-based approaches, which often involve encoding symbolic music (i.e., music represented in terms of discrete note events) in an image-like or language-like fashion. However, symbolic music is neither an image nor a sentence intrinsically, and research in the symbolic domain is lacking a comprehensive overview of the different available representations. In this paper, we investigate matrix (piano roll), sequence, and graph representations and their corresponding neural architectures, in combination with symbolic scores and performances on three piece-level classification tasks. We also introduce a novel graph representation for symbolic performances and explore the capability of graph representations in global classification tasks. Our systematic evaluation shows advantages and limitations of each input representation.",

    "abstract": "The semantic description of music metadata is a key requirement for the creation of music datasets that can be aligned, integrated, and accessed for information retrieval and knowledge discovery. It is nonetheless an open challenge due to the complexity of musical concepts arising from different genres, styles, and periods \u2013 standing to benefit from a lingua franca to accommodate various stakeholders (musicologists, librarians, data engineers, etc.). To initiate this transition, we introduce the Music Meta ontology, a rich and flexible semantic model to describe music metadata related to artists, compositions, performances, recordings, and links. We follow eXtreme Design methodologies and best practices for data engineering, to reflect the perspectives and the requirements of various stakeholders into the design of the model, while leveraging ontology design patterns and accounting for provenance at different levels (claims, links). After presenting the main features of Music Meta, we provide a first evaluation of the model, alignments to other schema (Music Ontology, DOREMUS, Wikidata), and support for data transformation.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale studies of musical harmony are often hampered by lack of suitably labelled data. It would be highly advantageous if an algorithm were able to autonomously describe chords, scales, etc. in a consistent and musically informative way. In this paper, we revisit tonal interval vectors (TIVs), which reveal certain insights as to the interval and tonal nature of pitch class sets. We then describe the qualities and criteria required to comprehensively and consistently measure displacements between TIVs. Next, we present the Polar Manhattan Displacement (PMD), a compound magnitude and phase measure for describing the displacements between pitch class sets in a tonally-informed manner. We end by providing examples of how PMD can be used in automated harmonic sequence analysis over a complex chord vocabulary.",
